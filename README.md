1.	Periodic Process Logger with Auto Scheduled Log Report Facility (Python Programming):
Description:
•	This application is developed in Python.
•	This project automate process log activity.
•	In this project we create log file with the current time and store information about all running processes as its name, PID, memory usage, thread count number of child process.
•	Our automation script executes periodically depends on the time specified by user using scheduler of python.
•	After periodic execution it send the log file to the specified email address.

3.	Titanic Survival Predictor (Python Programming):
Description:
•	This application based on supervised machine learning technique.
•	There is one data set which contains information about all passenger from titanic such as its name, age, seat number, ticket price, height, floor etc.
•	We first clean the data set by removing unnecessary entries and column.
•	We apply Logistic regression technique to train our dataset and predict whether the passenger can survive or not depends on its data entries.
